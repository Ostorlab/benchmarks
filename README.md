**Real vulnerabilities. Real impact. Real testing.**

The first open-source benchmark suite featuring 98 realistic vulnerable mobile applications that mirror actual CVE and bug bounty findings - not theoretical textbook examples.

*Testing security tools against real-world mobile vulnerabilities*

## **Overview**

Ostorlab Security Testing Benchmarks provides a comprehensive collection of vulnerable mobile applications based on **actual security incidents**, **CVE reports**, and **bug bounty findings**. Unlike academic exercises, these benchmarks reflect the vulnerabilities that security teams encounter in production environments.

### **Key Features**

- ‚ú® **93 Vulnerable Applications** - 72 Android and 21 iOS apps with realistic functionality
- üéØ **70+ Vulnerability Classes** - From authentication bypasses to complex logic flaws
- üí∞ **Bug Bounty Inspired** - Every vulnerability based on real findings worth actual bounties
- üîß **Automation Challenges** - Includes "impossible to automate" logical bugs
- üìä **Comprehensive Documentation** - Detailed exploitation guides and detection strategies

## **Why These Benchmarks?**

Traditional vulnerable app collections serve educational purposes but fail to represent modern mobile security challenges. After analyzing thousands of bug bounty reports, we identified a critical gap: **security teams need benchmarks that reflect actual production vulnerabilities**.

**The Reality:** A security scanner might catch 100% of SQL injections in test apps but miss critical logic flaws that constitute 60% of actual bug bounty payouts. These benchmarks measure what truly matters.

## **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**

- Git
- Android Studio 4.0+ (for Android apps)
- Xcode 12+ (for iOS apps)
- Java 8+ / Swift 5+

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/benchmarks.git
   cd benchmarks
   ```

2. **Navigate to your platform of choice**
   ```bash
   cd mobile/android  # For Android applications
   # or
   cd mobile/ios      # For iOS applications
   ```

3. **Choose an application and follow its README**
   ```bash
   cd banking-app
   # Each app contains:
   # - Source code
   # - Build instructions
   # - Vulnerability documentation
   # - Exploitation guides
   ```

## **Vulnerability Coverage**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- PIN/Passcode bypass mechanisms
- Two-factor authentication circumvention
- OAuth account takeover (missing PKCE)
- Biometric authentication bypasses
- Session persistence after password changes

### **Data Exposure**
- Firebase database takeover scenarios
- Cleartext storage of sensitive data
- Google Advertising ID misuse
- Location data exposure vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded production secrets

### **Complex Logic Flaws**
- Intent redirection vulnerabilities
- Task hijacking attack vectors
- Broadcast injection scenarios
- WebView JavaScript bridge exploitation
- Path traversal in archive processing

### **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities**

**Android-Specific:**
- Tapjacking vulnerabilities
- Unprotected critical activities
- Provider SQL injection
- Grant URI permission escalation

**iOS-Specific:**
- Deeplink CSRF attacks
- WebKit internal file access
- URL link spoofing
- Promotion code brute force
- Unencrypted session exposure
