# oxo-ios-ben7: iOS Deeplink Leading to Sensitive Action Performed Automatically

## Vulnerability Overview

iOS Deeplink Leading to Sensitive Action Performed Automatically occurs when iOS applications register custom URL schemes and implement deeplink handlers that automatically execute sensitive actions without proper user confirmation or authentication. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious deeplinks to trigger unauthorized money transfers without user consent.

## Attack Vector: Automatic Money Transfer via Deeplinks

**Brief Explanation**: An iOS finance application that registers the custom URL scheme `financetracker://` and implements a deeplink handler can be exploited to automatically perform money transfers when malicious deeplinks are triggered. The vulnerability lies in the lack of user confirmation and authentication when processing transfer parameters, allowing attackers to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized financial operations.


**Vulnerable Code Pattern:**
```swift
// VULNERABLE: URL scheme registration in Info.plist
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>financetracker</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>

// VULNERABLE: Automatic deeplink processing without validation
@main
struct FinanceTrackerApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .onOpenURL { url in
                    // VULNERABILITY: Automatic execution of sensitive actions
                    handleDeeplink(url: url)
                }
        }
    }
    
    // CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: Automatic money transfer without user consent
    private func handleTransferDeeplink(queryItems: [URLQueryItem]) {
        var fromAccount: String?
        var toAccount: String?
        var amount: Double = 0
        var reason: String = "Deeplink Transfer"
        
        for item in queryItems {
            switch item.name {
            case "from": fromAccount = item.value
            case "to": toAccount = item.value
            case "amount": amount = Double(item.value ?? "0") ?? 0
            case "reason": reason = item.value ?? "Deeplink Transfer"
            default: break
            }
        }
        
        // CRITICAL: No user confirmation or authentication required
        if let from = fromAccount, let to = toAccount, amount > 0 {
            executeAutomaticTransfer(from: from, to: to, amount: amount, reason: reason)
        }
    }
}
```

**Malicious Exploit URL:**
```bash
# MALICIOUS: Automatic money transfer without user consent
financetracker://transfer?from=main%20checking&to=savings%20account&amount=1000&reason=Emergency%20Transfer
```

The application contains a **vulnerable deeplink handler** that allows money transfers to be performed automatically without proper user confirmation or validation.

**Expected Malicious Results:**
```
Automatic Money Transfer:
ï¿½ Processing deeplink: financetracker://transfer?from=main%20checking&to=savings%20account&amount=1000&reason=Emergency%20Transfer
ðŸ’° Processing transfer deeplink...
ï¿½ðŸš¨ EXECUTING AUTOMATIC TRANSFER:
   From: main checking
   To: savings account
   Amount: $1000.0
   Reason: Emergency Transfer
âœ… TRANSFER EXECUTED AUTOMATICALLY!
   $1000.0 transferred from Main Checking to Savings Account
```

**Difficulty**: Medium

## Impact Assessment

- **Confidentiality**: Medium - Account information may be exposed through transfer logs
- **Integrity**: High - Unauthorized money transfers can be executed automatically
- **Availability**: Low - Normal app functionality remains available
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10**: M1 - Improper Platform Usage, M6 - Insecure Authorization
- **CWE**: CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-749 (Exposed Dangerous Method or Function)

2. Require authentication (PIN/biometric) before processing deeplinks
3. Validate and sanitize all deeplink parameters
4. Implement allowlist of safe deeplink operations
5. Add rate limiting to prevent automated deeplink abuse

### Best Practices
1. **User Consent**: Always require explicit user confirmation for sensitive actions
2. **Authentication**: Verify user identity before processing financial operations
3. **Parameter Validation**: Strictly validate all incoming deeplink parameters
4. **Action Logging**: Log all deeplink-triggered actions for audit trails
5. **Safe Operations Only**: Limit deeplinks to read-only or low-risk operations
6. **Token Validation**: Use cryptographic tokens to verify deeplink authenticity

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Intent Verification**: Implement cryptographic signatures for deeplink intents
2. **Session Validation**: Verify active user session before processing deeplinks
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate action risk level and require appropriate authentication
4. **Sandbox Mode**: Process potentially dangerous deeplinks in restricted mode
5. **User Education**: Warn users about deeplink risks and safe practices
