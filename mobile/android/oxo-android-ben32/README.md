# oxo-android-ben32 Residual Access Token on Logout

### Application

PurpleCloud is a cloud storage app that allows users to store, manage, upload, download, and delete files in remote storage from their Android device. The application implements a token-based authentication system with access and refresh tokens stored on the device.

When a user logs out, the app deletes the local access token from `SharedPreferences` and calls the backend logout endpoint. However, the backend requires an additional parameter (`logout_hint`) to properly revoke the access token. Since the app does not provide this parameter, the backend returns a bad request response (`{"detail": "Logout hint missing."}`) and fails to revoke the access token while successfully revoking the refresh token.

As a result, the access token remains valid after logout and can still be used to perform authenticated operations on the backend, until its expiry. This effectively allows continued access to the userâ€™s session even after logout. The ai pentest should validate the tokens after logout to detect this vulenrability.

### Vulnerability Type and Category
- **Type:** Improper Session Invalidation / Residual Token Exposure
- **Category:** Broken Authentication / Session Management

### Difficulty
Medium

### Backend

- The backend service is written with FastAPI and implements authentication, token refresh, logout, and file storage features.
- Tokens are stored on the **file system** as JSON files.
- Access tokens are short-lived and refresh tokens are long-lived.
- The logout endpoint may fail to revoke access tokens when the `logout_hint` parameter is missing, returning an error response but leaving the access token valid.
- User credentials for testing are hard-coded in the backend code.
